## Void Linux
On a (fresh) Void Linux Install, the `bin/install-void` script can be used to configure everything. All packages will be downloaded and properly configured.

## Arch Linux
As of now, there is no script to install everything from scratch, so you need to install the packages manually, followed by running the `bin/install` script.
